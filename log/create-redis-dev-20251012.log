初始化 Terraform

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "gcs"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/google versions matching ">= 5.0.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/google v7.6.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v7.6.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

google_redis_instance.redis: Refreshing state... [id=projects/vp-daytrader-dev-data/locations/asia-northeast3/instances/daytrader-redis-demo]

Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply" which may have affected this plan:

  # google_redis_instance.redis has been deleted
  - resource "google_redis_instance" "redis" {
      - host                        = "10.156.44.3" -> null
      - id                          = "projects/vp-daytrader-dev-data/locations/asia-northeast3/instances/daytrader-redis-demo" -> null
        name                        = "daytrader-redis-demo"
      - port                        = 6378 -> null
        # (25 unchanged attributes hidden)

        # (2 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include actions to undo or respond
to these changes.
